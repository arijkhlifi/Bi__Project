# Bi__Project
# Welcome to our E-Commerce Engineering Project

In this project, we developed a robust data pipeline for processing and analyzing diverse datasets from various sources. The methodology involves:

1. **Data Extraction and Loading (ETL):** Utilizing Python for efficient data extraction and loading.
2. **Data Storage and Management:** Storing and managing data in a structured format using MySQL, including schema design and SQL queries.
3. **Data Visualization and Analysis:** Leveraging Power BI to create insightful data visualizations and conduct comprehensive analysis.

This project showcases our ability to handle the entire data lifecycle, from data acquisition to meaningful insights.
# 1- ETL
This project utilizes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to process and prepare data for analysis. Python scripts, detailed in the accompanying PDF, were used to extract data from various sources, transform it into a consistent format, and load it into the designated data storage. This ETL process ensures data quality and enables accurate and insightful analysis.
# 2- Data Storage
This project utilizes a MySQL database for efficient data storage. The database schema was designed to accommodate project needs.
# 3-SQL Analysis
Experience the synergy of SQL Server and Power BI as we leverage queries to uncover valuable insights, enabling informed decision-making in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.
